# Diamond

A simple program that prints on stdout a "diamond" of a dimension given by user (with a letter, not a number).

Example with size 3 ('C'):
  A    
 B B  
C   C  
 B B  
  A  
  
Example with size 5 ('E'):
    A      
   B B    
  C   C    
 D     D   
E       E  
 D     D   
  C   C  
   B B  
    A  

It's a nice exercise to train loops and memory handling.
Enjoy!
